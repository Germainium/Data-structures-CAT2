1. Memory Allocation:
   Arrays:
     - Contiguous memory allocation.
     - They are fixed size (static arrays) or dynamic size (dynamic arrays).
     A single memory block is necessary for arrays during allocation.
  Linked Lists:
     - Non-contiguous memory allocation.
     The system allocates memory for individual nodes one after the other.
     The nodes within the linked list connect through pointer references.

2. Performance:
   Arrays:
     - Fast access to elements by index (O(1)).
     - Slower insertion/deletion in the middle (O(n)) due to shifting elements.
  inked Lists:
     - Slower access to elements by index (O(n)) due to traversal.
     The performance of singly linked lists enables O(1) operations for both addition and removal of elements when done at the start or at the end of the list.

3. Insertion and Deletion Operations:
   Arrays:
     The time complexity for end operations on arrays under available space conditions is O(1).
     - Insertion/deletion in the middle: O(n) due to shifting.
   Linked Lists:
     - Insertion/deletion at the beginning: O(1).
     Once maintained with a tail pointer the end operations run in O(n) time.
     Inserting or deleting elements within the list requires a traversal of all elements until the desired location making it take an O(n) complexity.
